                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        I'm an LSU student and developer passionate about solving problems and building innovative solutions from the ground up.
                        Throughout both my professional and academic journey, I've consistently taken the lead in  <span className="highlight">identifying challenges, developing solutions, and guiding teams to implement them effectively.</span>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        As an dedicated student in software development, I've taken Senior-level courses like <span className="highlight">Operating Systems, DBMS, and Software Systems,</span> earning top grades in each.
                        Despite being a Sophomore, I've sought to deepen my knowledge in advanced topics to better prepare myself for real-world challenges.
                        For the current Spring 2025 semester, I'll be taking exclusively Senior-level coursework, such as <span className="highlight">Software Testing and Compilers</span> (pray for me).
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Beyond coding, I enjoy sharing my love for building software with others. 
                        In that spirit, I served as <span className="highlight">Director of SASE GeauxHack '24</span>, LSU's premier Hackathon, where I helped create an environment where participants could dive into creating their own projects and experience what it's like to be a developer.

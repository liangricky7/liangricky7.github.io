                    <p>
                        Hello Again! Welcome to the other side of me!
                        While the other page shows off my professional side, here's the part of the site where I get to talk about who I am away from work.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        If I'm not in front of a computer coding, you might find me playing the guitar! 
                        Starting in my Junior year of Highschool, I've since hopped between all sorts of genres, but these days I've been into a lot of folk and rock. 
                        Currently, I'm learning <span className="highlightP"> "Don't Think Twice, It's Alright" by Bob Dylan. </span>
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        When I'm not making noice with a guitar, you'll find me at the gym!
                        I've come to love lifting weights over the past year and have found it as a core part of my day to day life (NEVER SKIP LEG DAY).
                        If you're interested, my main lift PRs are <span className="highlightP">185 on Bench, 265 on Squat, </span>and Deadlifts are still pending because of terrible form. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        {/* Between the sets and the strumming, I also love to read about history. */}
